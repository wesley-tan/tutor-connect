# EOD Summary ‚Äî July 21, 2025

## ‚úÖ What Has Been Done

### Authentication & Onboarding
- Supabase Auth (Google, Email) fully integrated on frontend and backend
- Onboarding flow prompts explicit role selection (student/tutor) after login
- Profile setup flow collects role-specific info and marks `profileCompleted: true` in Supabase metadata
- Zustand auth store updated with `setUser`, `setSession`, and profile refresh logic
- Auth callback and dashboard layout refactored to prevent redirect loops and ensure correct onboarding/profile gating
- API client (Axios) now attaches Supabase access token to all requests

### Backend API
- All protected routes now use `authenticateSupabaseToken` middleware (verifies Supabase tokens, not legacy JWT)
- New `supabaseAuth.ts` utility for backend token verification and user sync
- User is auto-created in DB on first Supabase login if not present
- All major API endpoints (sessions, users, tutors, conversations, etc.) updated to use new auth

### Dashboard & Role-Based Flows
- Dashboard layout and navigation implemented
- Role-based dashboard content (student/tutor) in place
- Profile setup and onboarding flows are enforced before dashboard access
- Test page `/test-auth-flow` for debugging auth/session state

### Bug Fixes & Improvements
- Fixed white text in test page for better readability
- Fixed registration and onboarding to not assume default user type
- Fixed profile setup to update Supabase metadata and refresh auth store
- Removed all legacy JWT auth from backend routes

## ‚ùå What Has NOT Been Done

### Critical Infrastructure
- [ ] **Production-ready error handling** for all backend routes
- [ ] **Automated tests** for auth/session flows (manual testing only so far)
- [ ] **CI/CD pipeline** for backend/frontend
- [ ] **Comprehensive environment variable validation** (backend will crash if Supabase env vars missing)

### Frontend Features
- [ ] **Find Tutors Page** (`/dashboard/tutors`):
  - Search, filter, and display tutors
  - Tutor profile modal
- [ ] **Session Management Page** (`/dashboard/sessions`):
  - Calendar, booking, session history
- [ ] **Messages Page** (`/dashboard/messages`):
  - Real-time chat, conversation list, file sharing
- [ ] **Profile Page** (`/dashboard/profile`):
  - Edit profile, role-specific sections, avatar upload
- [ ] **Payments/Checkout**: Stripe integration not yet live
- [ ] **Review System**: Post-session feedback, ratings

### Backend/API
- [ ] **Socket.io integration** for real-time messaging
- [ ] **Rate limiting, monitoring, and logging improvements**
- [ ] **Swagger/OpenAPI documentation**
- [ ] **Unit/integration tests for all endpoints**
- [ ] **Database backup/restore scripts**

### UI/UX
- [ ] **Mobile responsiveness** for all dashboard pages
- [ ] **Loading and error states** for all forms and API calls
- [ ] **Onboarding tutorial and smart matching**

## üìù What Needs to Be Implemented Next

### High Priority (This Week)
- [] rn session and messages cannot be accessed, times out and returns back to login
- [ ] to simplify things, we can allow people to toggle between student and tutor on the dashboard
- tutors should be able to see all students and vice versa, and tutees should see all tutors
- [ ] Complete all dashboard subpages: Tutors, Sessions, Messages, Profile
- [ ] Finish role-based profile management (edit, avatar, preferences)
- [ ] Implement session booking and calendar
- [ ] Integrate real-time chat (Socket.io)
- [ ] Add payment and review flows
- [ ] Harden backend error handling and add tests
- [ ] Add environment variable validation and better error messages
- [ ] STRIPE API INTEGRATION

### Medium Priority
- [ ] Mobile UI polish and accessibility improvements
- [ ] Add onboarding tutorial and learning path recommendations
- [ ] Implement rate limiting and monitoring
- [ ] Add API documentation (Swagger)


### Low Priority
- [ ] PWA support, advanced analytics, referral/monetization features

## üö¶ Blockers & Risks
- **Backend will crash if Supabase env vars are missing** ‚Äî must be set in all environments
- **No automated tests** ‚Äî risk of regressions as features are added
- **No production monitoring or error tracking yet**

## üìÖ Next Steps (July 22+)
1. Finish all dashboard and profile management features
2. Integrate real-time messaging and session booking
3. Add payments, reviews, and polish onboarding
4. Harden backend and add tests/monitoring
5. Prepare for MVP launch
